The Data Sorter Tool is an interactive, console-based application developed to help students and programmers explore and understand the performance of different sorting algorithms. The program allows users to either input a custom list of numbers or generate a random dataset automatically. It provides implementations of three widely studied sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. For each algorithm, the tool displays the sorted output clearly and measures both the execution time and the number of operations performed, offering a tangible demonstration of algorithmic efficiency. Results are summarized in an easy-to-read comparison format, enabling users to visualize the impact of algorithmic complexity on performance. With its simple, menu-driven interface and robust input validation, the Data Sorter Tool serves as a practical educational resource for understanding arrays, algorithm design, and computational complexity, making it ideal for both learning and teaching purposes.
